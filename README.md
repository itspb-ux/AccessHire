# ♿ AccessHire – Accessible Hiring Platform

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Persons with Disabilities (PwD) face significant barriers in accessing employment opportunities due to:

- Inaccessible job portals
- Non-inclusive application processes
- Lack of assistive features such as screen reader support
- Limited access to skill development resources
- Employers lacking simple tools to adopt inclusive hiring practices

At the same time, employers—especially MSMEs—struggle to find verified, skilled PwD candidates and manage inclusive hiring efficiently.
